# OpenRefine
Data for use with the Digital Humanities Lab's course on OpenRefine

### Charles Woolf Collection
This is an export from the CALM catalogue management system, and holds metadata of the collection also displayed on JSTOR at: 
https://www.jstor.org/site/university-of-exeter/woolf/

The full dataset, exported directly from the catalogue, shows a number of features that can be collectively cleaned, and also some features that are more problematic to deal with, but is typical of the kind of data that OpenRefine can help to standardise and extract meaning from.

Click on the file above labelled [CharlesWoolfSlideCollection_CALMexport.xlsx](https://github.com/ExeterDigitalHumanities/openrefine/blob/main/CharlesWoolfSlideCollection_CALMexport.xlsx) to download the data.

The images referred to in this metadata were catalogued by the team at Falmouth Archives, and are copyright. The slides themselves were transferred from the Estate of Charles Woolf to the Institute of Cornish Studies in 2016. Metadata is reproduced with permission.
